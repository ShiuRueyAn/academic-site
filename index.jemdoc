== About me
I am a fifth-year undergraduate at [https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/ National Taiwan University] majoring in Mathematics and Economics (Honor), with a minor in Computer Science. My research focuses on mathematical modeling of strategic interactions and dynamic systems, with particular expertise in stochastic processes, financial mathematics, dynamical systems, and algorithmic game theory. \n

Currently, I am engaged in several collaborative research projects:

- I study synchronization phenomena in nonlinear oscillator networks under the guidance of [https://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/en/entity_people/entity_people/21478/ Prof. Chun-Hsiung Hsia].

- I work on variants of the jump-diffusion model in financial engineering with [https://www.fn.ntust.edu.tw/p/412-1002-10119.php?Lang=en Prof. Daniel Wei-Chung Miao].

- I explore opinion dynamics in multiplex social networks with [https://parinazn.com// Prof. Parinaz Naghizadeh].

- I develop robust principal–agent models in mechanism design with [https://www.haifeng-xu.com// Prof. Haifeng Xu].

- I also investigate computational sociology and mathematical epidemiology with [https://sites.google.com/view/hsuanweilee/home/ Prof. Hsuan-Wei "Wayne" Lee].

I am preparing to apply for Ph.D. programs in applied mathematics, operations research, or algorithmic game theory for Fall 2026, with the goal of advancing mathematical frameworks that bridge theoretical foundations with real-world strategic systems. My CV can be found [CV.pdf here].
